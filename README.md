##🎮 About the Game
CodenameMansion is a point-and-click escape adventure set inside an old, mysterious mansion filled with secrets, danger, puzzles, and a dark family curse. The game draws inspiration from Monkey Island, Resident Evil, and classic escape-room puzzle games, mixing narrative-driven storytelling with exploration and clever puzzle-solving.
You play as Alex, who receives a strange letter from his uncle urging him to visit a mansion connected to a long-standing family curse tied to the Daggerblade. Once inside, Alex must explore the eerie rooms, uncover hidden clues, solve puzzles, and piece together the truth behind the curse—while staying one step ahead of the dangers lurking in the shadows.

##🛠 About the Project
CodenameMansion was created in Unity by a team of 17 people over the course of 4 weeks.
**I worked on:**
UI implementation (inventory layout, interaction prompts, and general UI flow)
Camera switching system for different rooms and interaction angles
Door unlocking logic, including lock-based interactions and puzzle triggers
General scripting support across different gameplay systems
This project helped me understand teamwork, communication, and writing clean scripts that fit well into a larger workflow.
